# toyDB

Distributed SQL database in RUST, written as a learning project.

## Project Outline

-  [x] **Networking:** gRPC, no security.

-  [ ] **Storage:** Self-written key-value engine using LSM-tree and/or B+-trees, with secondary indexes. MessagePack for serialization. No log compaction or write-ahead log.

- [ ] **Consensus**: Self-written Raft implementation, handling all writes
and reads. Node time is (naively) considered accurate.

- [ ] **Data Types**: Support for nulls, booleans, signed 64-bit doubles,
and short UTF-8 strings.

- [ ] **Constraints:** Singular required primary keys, unique indexes, and foreign keys.

- [ ] **Transactions:** MVCC-based serializable snapshot isolation.

- [ ] **Query Engine:** Simple hueristic-based planner and optimizer
supporting expressions, functions, and inner joins.

- [ ] **Language:** Basic SQL support
    *`[CREATE|DROP] TABLE ...` and `[CREATE | DROP] INDEX ...`
    *`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK`
    *`INSERT INTO [TABLE] (...) VALUES (...)`
    *`UPDATE [TABLE] SET ... WHERE ...`
    *`DELETE FROM [TABLE] WHERE ...`
    *`SELECT ... FROM ... WHERE ... ORDER BY ...`
    *`EXPLAIN SELECT ...`

- [ ] **Client:** Simple interactive REPL client over gRPC.
